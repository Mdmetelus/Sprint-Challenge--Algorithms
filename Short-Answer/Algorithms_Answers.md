Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

A. O(n); This code is linear time complexity. loop ends after two runs, and as n increases so does the number of operations

B. 0(n^3); This code is quadrratic time complexity.
As  n increased the number of operations increasess substantially due to the 4 nested for loops, but he loops don't all quiterase the exponet to the next power (so it can't be O(n^4)).

C. O(n); This code is linear time complexity. This code is one recursive loop thant repeated until it hits zero.


 a binary strategy:
    Go to middle floor.Then Throw the egg
    If it breaks, 
    pick a new floor below that. 
    Elseif no break, pick a new floor above.
    THe New floor would be approximately half of the remaining stairs for either direction.
Repeats recursively until I find the value of what f equals.

 O(n); This code is linear time complexity.
