Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

A. O(n); This code is linear time complexity. loop ends after two runs, and as n increases so does the number of operations

B. O(n**2) actually 0(n**4); This code is linear time complexity.
As  n increased the number of operations increasess substantiallydue to the nested for loops.

C. O(n); This code is linear time complexity. This code is one recursive loop
